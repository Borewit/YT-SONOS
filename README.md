## YouTube to Sonos devices.
This program was built with ElectronJS and an ExpressJS server, the main goal of this program is to
send music from YouTube URLs to Sonos Devices.


## This is only in beta, currently testing.
If you have any issues please report them.




## I will update this when there is more to come.
